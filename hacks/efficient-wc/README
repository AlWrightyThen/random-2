Efficiently keep track of the number of lines in a file over a long period,
rather than running "wc -l" every N minutes.

On startup, we count the number of lines in the file, then we keep a rolling
count with "tail -f".  On a signal, we write the number of lines into our
output file and continue.

Implemented using Perl's File::Tail which supplies most of the mechanics
we need in one handy package.
